 *
 * Donation are always welcome! Please check http://www.multiotp.net

 *
 * If the name of this file is multiotp.php, it means that it is already
 * the result of the merge of the two files multiotp.cli.header.php and
 * multiotp.class.php
 *
 * The MultiOTP PHP CLI header is simply merged with the MultiOTP PHP
 * class in order to provide an authentication command line script.
 *
 * This script can be used as an external authentication provider with at
 * least the following RADIUS servers:
 *  - TekRADIUS LT, a free Radius server for Windows with SQLite backend
 *    (http:/www.tekradius.com)
 *  - TekRADIUS, a free Radius server for Windows with MS-SQL backend
 *    (http:/www.tekradius.com)
 *  - FreeRADIUS, a free Radius server implementation for Linux
 *    and *nix environments (http://freeradius.org)
 *  - FreeRADIUS for Windows, a free Radius server implementation ported
 *    for Windows (http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeradius/)
 *
 * For Windows, you can also use the multiotp.exe file provided, which is
 * an embedded PHP interpreter together with the result of the merge.

 * Radius integration examples
 *
 *   Example 1 (FreeRADIUS 2.x under Linux or Windows, new fashion)
 *
 *     Have a look in the readme file, everything is explained.
 *
 *
 *   Example 2 (FreeRADIUS under Linux or Windows, old fashion)
 *
 *     Define a DEFAULT entry in the /etc/freeradius/users file like this:
 *     DEFAULT Auth-Type = Accept
 *     Exec-Program-Wait = "/usr/local/bin/multiotp.php %{User-Name} %{User-Password}",
 *     Fall-Through = Yes,
 *     Reply-Message = "Hello, %{User-Name}"
 *
 *
 *   Example 3 (TekRADIUS or TekRADIUS LT under Windows)
 *
 *     TekRADIUS supports a Default Username to be used when a matching user
 *     profile cannot be found for an incoming RADIUS authentication request.
 *     So a quick and easy way is to create in the TekRADIUS Manager a User
 *     named 'Default' that belongs to the existing 'Default' Group.
 *     Then add to this Default user the following attribute :
 *     Check  External-Executable  C:\multitop\multiotp.exe %ietf|1% %ietf|2%
 *
 *
 * External files created
 *
 *   Users database files in the subfolder called users
 *   Tokens database files in the subfolder called tokens
 *
 *
 * External file needed
 *
 *   Users database files in the subfolder called users
 *   Tokens database files in the subfolder called tokens

 * multiOTP PHP class - strong two-factor authentication PHP class
 * multiOTP is OATH certified for TOTP/HOTP
 *
 * http://www.multiOTP.net/
 *
 * Visit http://forum.multiotp.net/ for additional support.
 *
 * The multiOTP package is the lightest package available that provides so many
 * strong authentication functionalities and goodies, and best of all, for anyone
 * that is interested about security issues, it's a fully open source solution!
 *
 * This package is the result of a *bunch* of work. If you are happy using this
 * package, [Donation] are always welcome to support this project.
 * Please check http://www.multiOTP.net/ and you will find the magic button ;-)
 * (OATH membership and certifications are not free, sponsorship welcome)
 *
 * If you need some specific features in the open source edition of multiOTP,
 * please contact us in order to discuss about a sponsorship in order to
 * prioritize your needs.
 *
 * This project is *NOT* sponsored by NSA.
 *
 * The multiOTP class is a strong authentication class in pure PHP
 * that supports the following algorithms (mOTP is recommended):
 *  - OATH/HOTP RFC 4226 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226)
 *  - OATH/TOTP RFC 6238 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238)
 *  - Google Authenticator (OATH/HOTP or OATH/TOTP, base32 seed, QRcode provisioning)
 *    (http://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/)
 *  - mOTP (http://motp.sourceforge.net/)
 *  - emergency scratch passwords
 *  - SMS tokens
 *
 * This class can be used as is in your own PHP project, but it can also be
 * used easily as an external authentication provider with at least the
 * following RADIUS servers (using the multiotp command line script):
 *  - FreeRADIUS, a free RADIUS server implementation for Linux and

 *                                PAP mode: if self-registration is enabled, a user can register a non-attributed token by typing
 *                                [serial number][OTP] instead of [OTP]. If user has a prefix PIN, type [serial number][PIN][OTP])
 *                                PAP/CHAP mode: if self-registration is enabled, a user can register a non-attributed token by typing
 *                                [username:serialnumber] as the username and the [OTP] in the password field. If user has a prefix PIN,
 *                                he must type [PIN][OTP] in the password field
 *                               Automatic resync/unlock option during authentication (PAP only). When the autoresync option is enabled,
 *                                any user can resync his token by typing [OTP1] [OTP2] in the password field. If user has a prefix PIN,
 *                                he must type [PIN][OTP1] [PIN][OTP2].

 *                               Added GetUsersCount() function
 *                               Added GenerateSmsToken() function
 *                               Added Groups management functions
 *                               Added Tokens assignation functions
 *                               Added SetUserActivated(1|0) and GetUserActivated() function

 *                               Some modifications in order to correctly handle the class methods
 *   2013-09-22 4.0.9   SysCo/al Fixed a bug in GetUserScratchPasswordsArray. If a user had no scratch password
 *                                and the implementation accepted blank password, it was accepted
 *                               Fixed a bug where scratch passwords generation used odd numbers of characters for hex2bin()
 *   2013-08-30 4.0.7   SysCo/al GetScriptFolder() was still buggy sometimes, thanks Frank for the feedback
 *                               File mode of the created QRcode file is also changed based on GetLinuxFileMode()
 *                               'sms' as the password to request an SMS token can now be sent in lower or uppercase
 *                               Added a description attribute for the tokens
 *   2013-08-25 4.0.6   SysCo/al base32_encode() is now RFC compliant with uppercases
 *                               GetUserTokenQrCode() and GetTokenQrCode() where buggy

 * Description
 *
 *   The Syslog class is a syslog device implementation in PHP
 *   following the RFC 3164 rules
 *   (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3164.html)
 *   (ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3164.txt)
 *
 *   Facility values:
 *      0 kernel messages
 *      1 user-level messages
 *      2 mail system
 *      3 system daemons
 *      4 security/authorization messages
 *      5 messages generated internally by syslogd
 *      6 line printer subsystem
 *      7 network news subsystem
 *      8 UUCP subsystem
 *      9 clock daemon
 *     10 security/authorization messages
 *     11 FTP daemon
 *     12 NTP subsystem
 *     13 log audit
 *     14 log alert
 *     15 clock daemon
 *     16 local user 0 (local0) (default value)
 *     17 local user 1 (local1)
 *     18 local user 2 (local2)
 *     19 local user 3 (local3)

 *     22 local user 6 (local6)
 *     23 local user 7 (local7)
 *
 *   Severity values:
 *     0 Emergency: system is unusable
 *     1 Alert: action must be taken immediately
 *     2 Critical: critical conditions
 *     3 Error: error conditions
 *     4 Warning: warning conditions
 *     5 Notice: normal but significant condition (default value)
 *     6 Informational: informational messages
 *     7 Debug: debug-level messages
 *
 *
 * Usage
 *
 *   require_once('syslog.php');
 *   $syslog = new Syslog($facility = 16, $severity = 5, $hostname = "", $fqdn= "", $ip_from = "", $process="", $content = "");
 *   $syslog->Send($server = "", $content = "", $timeout = 0);
 *
 *
 * Examples
 *
 *   Example 1
 *      *         require_once('syslog.php');
 *         $syslog = new Syslog();
 *         $syslog->Send('192.168.0.12', 'My first PHP syslog message');
 *      *
 *   Example 2
 *      *         require_once('syslog.php');
 *         $syslog = new Syslog(23, 7, 'MYSERVER', 'myserver.mydomain.net', '192.168.0.1', 'webautomation');
 *         $syslog->Send('192.168.0.12', 'My second PHP syslog message');
 *      *
 *   Example 3
 *      *         require_once('syslog.php');
 *         $syslog = new Syslog();
 *         $syslog->SetFacility(23);
 *         $syslog->SetSeverity(7);
 *         $syslog->SetHostname('MYSERVER');
 *         $syslog->SetFqdn('myserver.mydomain.net');
 *         $syslog->SetIpFrom('192.168.0.1');
 *         $syslog->SetProcess('webautomation');
 *         $syslog->SetContent('My third PHP syslog message');
 *         $syslog->SetServer('192.168.0.12');
 *         $syslog->Send();
 *      *
 *   Example 4
 *      *         // Do not follow the conventions of the RFC
 *         // and send a customized MSG part instead of
 *         // the recommanded format "process fqdn ip content"
 *         require_once('syslog.php');
 *         $syslog = new Syslog();
 *         $syslog->SetFacility(23);
 *         $syslog->SetSeverity(7);
 *         $syslog->SetHostname('MYSERVER');
 *         $syslog->SetMsg('My customized MSG PHP syslog message');
 *         $syslog->SetServer('192.168.0.12');
 *         $syslog->Send();
 *      *
 *
 * External file needed
 *
 *   none.
 *
 *
 * External file created
 *
 *   none.
 *
 *
 * Special issues
 *
 *   - Sockets support must be enabled.
 *     * In Linux and *nix environments, the extension is enabled at
 *       compile time using the --enable-sockets configure option
 *     * In Windows, PHP Sockets can be activated by un-commenting
 *       extension=php_sockets.dll in php.ini

/**
 * Pure-PHP arbitrary precision integer arithmetic library.
 *
 * Supports base-2, base-10, base-16, and base-256 numbers.  Uses the GMP or BCMath extensions, if available,
 * and an internal implementation, otherwise.
 *
 * PHP versions 4 and 5
 *
 * {@internal (all DocBlock comments regarding implementation - such as the one that follows - refer to the
 * {@link MATH_BIGINTEGER_MODE_INTERNAL MATH_BIGINTEGER_MODE_INTERNAL} mode)
 *
 * Math_BigInteger uses base-2**26 to perform operations such as multiplication and division and
 * base-2**52 (ie. two base 2**26 digits) to perform addition and subtraction.  Because the largest possible
 * value when multiplying two base-2**26 numbers together is a base-2**52 number, double precision floating
 * point numbers - numbers that should be supported on most hardware and whose significand is 53 bits - are
 * used.  As a consequence, bitwise operators such as >> and << cannot be used, nor can the modulo operator %,
 * which only supports integers.  Although this fact will slow this library down, the fact that such a high
 * base is being used should more than compensate.
 *
 * When PHP version 6 is officially released, we'll be able to use 64-bit integers.  This should, once again,
 * allow bitwise operators, and will increase the maximum possible base to 2**31 (or 2**62 for addition /
 * subtraction).
 *
 * Numbers are stored in {@link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness little endian} format.  ie.
 * (new Math_BigInteger(pow(2, 26)))->value = array(0, 1)
 *
 * Useful resources are as follows:
 *
 *  - {@link http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap14.pdf Handbook of Applied Cryptography (HAC)}
 *  - {@link http://math.libtomcrypt.com/files/tommath.pdf Multi-Precision Math (MPM)}
 *  - Java's BigInteger classes.  See /j2se/src/share/classes/java/math in jdk-1_5_0-src-jrl.zip
 *
 * Here's an example of how to use this library:
 * <code>
 *  *    include('Math/BigInteger.php');
 *
 *    $a = new Math_BigInteger(2);
 *    $b = new Math_BigInteger(3);
 *
 *    $c = $a->add($b);
 *
 *    echo $c->toString(); // outputs 5

     * @internal The most naive approach to modular exponentiation has very unreasonable requirements, and
     *    and although the approach involving repeated squaring does vastly better, it, too, is impractical
     *    for our purposes.  The reason being that division - by far the most complicated and time-consuming
     *    of the basic operations (eg. +,-,*,/) - occurs multiple times within it.
     *
     *    Modular reductions resolve this issue.  Although an individual modular reduction takes more time
     *    then an individual division, when performed in succession (with the same modulo), they're a lot faster.
     *
     *    The two most commonly used modular reductions are Barrett and Montgomery reduction.  Montgomery reduction,
     *    although faster, only works when the gcd of the modulo and of the base being used is 1.  In RSA, when the
     *    base is a power of two, the modulo - a product of two primes - is always going to have a gcd of 1 (because
     *    the product of two odd numbers is odd), but what about when RSA isn't used?
     *
     *    In contrast, Barrett reduction has no such constraint.  As such, some bigint implementations perform a
     *    Barrett reduction after every operation in the modpow function.  Others perform Barrett reductions when the
     *    modulo is even and Montgomery reductions when the modulo is odd.  BigInteger.java's modPow method, however,
     *    uses a trick involving the Chinese Remainder Theorem to factor the even modulo into two numbers - one odd and
     *    the other, a power of two - and recombine them, later.  This is the method that this modPow function uses.
     *    {@link http://islab.oregonstate.edu/papers/j34monex.pdf Montgomery Reduction with Even Modulus} elaborates.

            because, for sufficiently small ranges, the likelihood that you'd get a number within that range
            would be pretty small. eg. with $random's max being 255 and if your $max being 1 the probability
            would be pretty high that $random would be greater than $max.

            phpseclib works around this using the technique described here:

     * With the continuous buffer disabled, these would yield the same output.  With it enabled, they yield different

     * Put another way, when the continuous buffer is enabled, the state of the Crypt_*() object changes after each
     * encryption / decryption round, whereas otherwise, it'd remain constant.  For this reason, it's recommended that
     * continuous buffers not be used.  They do offer better security and are, in fact, sometimes required (SSH uses them),

     * Setup the performance-optimized function for de/encrypt()
     *
     * Stores the created (or existing) callback function-name

     * Internally for phpseclib developers:

     *
     *     - each time on _setup(), after(!) _setupKey()
     *
     *
     *     This ensures that _setupInlineCrypt() has allways a
     *     full ready2go initializated internal cipher $engine state
     *     where, for example, the keys allready expanded,
     *     keys/block_size calculated and such.
     *
     *     It is, each time if called, the responsibility of _setupInlineCrypt():
     *
     *     - to set $this->inline_crypt to a valid and fully working callback function
     *       as a (faster) replacement for encrypt() / decrypt()
     *
     *     - NOT to create unlimited callback functions (for memory reasons!)
     *       no matter how often _setupInlineCrypt() would be called. At some
     *       point of amount they must be generic re-useable.
     *
     *     - the code of _setupInlineCrypt() it self,
     *       and the generated callback code,
     *       must be, in following order:
     *       - 100% safe
     *       - 100% compatible to encrypt()/decrypt()
     *       - using only php5+ features/lang-constructs/php-extensions if
     *         compatibility (down to php4) or fallback is provided
     *       - readable/maintainable/understandable/commented and... not-cryptic-styled-code :-)
     *       - >= 10% faster than encrypt()/decrypt() [which is, by the way,
     *         the reason for the existence of _setupInlineCrypt() :-)]
     *       - memory-nice
     *       - short (as good as possible)
     *
     * Note: - _setupInlineCrypt() is using _createInlineCryptFunction() to create the full callback function code.
     *       - In case of using inline crypting, _setupInlineCrypt() must extend by the child Crypt_* class.
     *       - The following variable names are reserved:
     *         - $_*  (all variable names prefixed with an underscore)
     *         - $self (object reference to it self. Do not use $this, but $self instead)
     *         - $in (the content of $in has to en/decrypt by the generated code)
     *       - The callback function should not use the 'return' statement, but en/decrypt'ing the content of $in only

     *      in the mode of operation for() loop.

 *
 * Not all Rijndael implementations may support 160-bits or 224-bits as the block length / key length.  mcrypt, for example,

 * are first defined as valid key / block lengths in
 * {@link http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/rijndael/Rijndael-ammended.pdf#page=44 Rijndael-ammended.pdf#page=44}:
 * Extensions: Other block and Cipher Key lengths.
 * Note: Use of 160/224-bit Keys must be explicitly set by setKeyLength(160) respectively setKeyLength(224).
 *
 * {@internal The variable names are the same as those in

 * Pure-PHP implementation of AES.

 * Uses mcrypt, if available/possible, and an internal implementation, otherwise.
 *
 * PHP versions 4 and 5
 *
 * If {@link Crypt_AES::setKeyLength() setKeyLength()} isn't called, it'll be calculated from
 * {@link Crypt_AES::setKey() setKey()}.  ie. if the key is 128-bits, the key length will be 128-bits.  If it's 136-bits
 * it'll be null-padded to 192-bits and 192 bits will be the key length until {@link Crypt_AES::setKey() setKey()}
 * is called, again, at which point, it'll be recalculated.
 *
 * Since Crypt_AES extends Crypt_Rijndael, some functions are available to be called that, in the context of AES, don't
 * make a whole lot of sense.  {@link Crypt_AES::setBlockLength() setBlockLength()}, for instance.  Calling that function,
 * however possible, won't do anything (AES has a fixed block length whereas Rijndael has a variable one).
 *
 * Here's a short example of how to use this library:
 * <code>
 *  *    include('Crypt/AES.php');
 *
 *    $aes = new Crypt_AES();
 *
 *    $aes->setKey('abcdefghijklmnop');
 *
 *    $size = 10 * 1024;
 *    $plaintext = '';
 *    for ($i = 0; $i < $size; $i++) {
 *        $plaintext.= 'a';
 *    }
 *
 *    echo $aes->decrypt($aes->encrypt($plaintext));

 * Pure-PHP implementation of DES.
 *
 * Uses mcrypt, if available, and an internal implementation, otherwise.
 *
 * PHP versions 4 and 5
 *
 * Useful resources are as follows:
 *
 *  - {@link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DES_supplementary_material Wikipedia: DES supplementary material}
 *  - {@link http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip46-2.htm FIPS 46-2 - (DES), Data Encryption Standard}
 *  - {@link http://www.cs.eku.edu/faculty/styer/460/Encrypt/JS-DES.html JavaScript DES Example}
 *
 * Here's a short example of how to use this library:
 * <code>
 *  *    include('Crypt/DES.php');
 *
 *    $des = new Crypt_DES();
 *
 *    $des->setKey('abcdefgh');
 *
 *    $size = 10 * 1024;
 *    $plaintext = '';
 *    for ($i = 0; $i < $size; $i++) {
 *        $plaintext.= 'a';
 *    }
 *
 *    echo $des->decrypt($des->encrypt($plaintext));

     * With the continuous buffer disabled, these would yield the same output.  With it enabled, they yield different
     * outputs.  The reason is due to the fact that the initialization vector's change after every encryption /
     * decryption round when the continuous buffer is enabled.  When it's disabled, they remain constant.
     *
     * Put another way, when the continuous buffer is enabled, the state of the Crypt_DES() object changes after each
     * encryption / decryption round, whereas otherwise, it'd remain constant.  For this reason, it's recommended that
     * continuous buffers not be used.  They do offer better security and are, in fact, sometimes required (SSH uses them),
     * however, they are also less intuitive and more likely to cause you problems.

                   protect private keys, however, that's not what OpenSSL* does.  OpenSSL protects private keys by adding
                   two new "fields" to the key - DEK-Info and Proc-Type.  These fields are discussed here:

                   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1421#section-4.6.1.1
                   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1421#section-4.6.1.3

                   DES-EDE3-CBC as an algorithm, however, is not discussed anywhere, near as I can tell.
                   DES-CBC and DES-EDE are discussed in RFC1423, however, DES-EDE3-CBC isn't, nor is its key derivation
                   function.  As is, the definitive authority on this encoding scheme isn't the IETF but rather OpenSSL's
                   own implementation.  ie. the implementation *is* the standard and any bugs that may exist in that
                   implementation are part of the standard, as well.

     * The reason being that RFC2313#section-8.1 (PKCS#1 v1.5) states that ciphertext's encrypted by the

     * public key should have the second byte set to 2.  In RFC3447 (PKCS#1 v2.1), the second byte is supposed
     * to be 2 regardless of which key is used.  For compatability purposes, we'll just check to make sure the
     * second byte is 2 or less.  If it is, we'll accept the decrypted string as valid.
     *
     * As a consequence of this, a private key encrypted ciphertext produced with Crypt_RSA may not decrypt
     * with a strictly PKCS#1 v1.5 compliant RSA implementation.  Public key encrypted ciphertext's should but
     * not private key encrypted ciphertext's.
